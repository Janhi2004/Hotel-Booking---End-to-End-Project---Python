# Hotel Booking Cancellations Analysis

## Business Problem
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. This has led to several issues, including reduced revenues and suboptimal hotel room utilization. Consequently, reducing cancellation rates is a primary goal for both hotels to enhance their revenue generation efficiency. This project aims to analyze hotel booking cancellations and other factors affecting their business and annual revenue generation, ultimately offering comprehensive business advice to address this problem.

## Research Questions
1. What variables affect hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can hotel reservation cancellations be reduced?
3. How can hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## Hypotheses
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. Customers tend to cancel more frequently when there is a longer waiting list.
3. The majority of clients make reservations through offline travel agents.

## Analysis and Findings
### Reservation Status Count
- The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of reservations that are canceled and those that are not. While a significant number of reservations are not canceled, 37% of clients cancel their reservations, significantly impacting the hotels' earnings.

### Reservation Status in Different Hotels
- City hotels have more bookings compared to resort hotels. This could be due to resort hotels being more expensive than city hotels.

### Average Daily Rate in City and Resort Hotels
- The line graph shows that, on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of a resort hotel, and on other days, it is even lower. It is evident that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates.

### Reservation Status Per Month
- The grouped bar graph analyzes the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. Both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of canceled reservations are highest in August, while January has the most canceled reservations.

## Suggestions
1. **Pricing Strategies:** Cancellation rates rise as prices increase. Hotels could adjust their pricing strategies and lower rates for specific hotels based on location. Offering discounts to customers may also help reduce cancellations.
2. **Weekend and Holiday Discounts:** The ratio of cancellations to non-cancellations is higher in resort hotels than in city hotels. Hotels should consider providing reasonable discounts on room prices during weekends and holidays.
3. **Marketing Campaigns in January:** Since January has the highest cancellation rates, hotels can initiate marketing campaigns or promotions during this month to increase revenue.
4. **Quality and Service Improvements:** Improving the quality of hotels and their services, particularly in Portugal, could help reduce cancellation rates.
